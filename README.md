# RC-Car-PIC32# Remote Control Car

## Project Description

The Remote Control Car project allows you to control a car using WiFi. You can send control commands from a touchscreen on a microcontroller board to the car, making it move forward, backward, start, and stop. This project utilizes components such as the EasyPic Fusion v7 development board, 320x240 TFT display with touchscreen, PIC32 microcontroller, and the DC Motor 4 Click motor driver.
